Install ECLYPSE
===============

ECLYPSE can be installed using `pip <https://pypi.org/project/eclypse/>`_.

.. note::

    Do not use the global environment to install ECLYPSE.
    It is recommended to create a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_ first.

To install ECLYPSE, run the following command:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip install eclypse

Now you are ready to run :doc:`your first ECLYPSE simulation <getting-started/index>`!
