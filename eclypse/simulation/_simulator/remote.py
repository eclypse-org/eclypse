"""Module for the RemoteSimulator class. It operates like the local simulator, but
performs the simulation using ray actors. It also performs operations on the Services

The RemoteSimulator is also the entry point for the communication between services, as
it ask to the infrastructure the computation of the routes between them, retrieving the
